! DHCP range: 123.45.67.98 - 123.45.67.98 for 1 address
! This is the pseudo-static address that HomeNet is allocated
! Only HomeNet uses WAN-sided DHCP
! The other customers are allocated CIDR blocks that have to be statically-assigned from their side
! Packet Tracer does not have DHCP reservation, which is why it is done this way

ip dhcp excluded-address 123.45.67.97 123.45.67.97
