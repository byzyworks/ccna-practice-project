! This device is used to demonstrate totally stubby areas, where it's not supposed to send or receive inter-area summary routes.
! By only sending out a default route to each of these areas, the primary router in each of them can still send out inter-area routes that are preferred.
! The default routes from this router are only meant to get used if the primary router of the particular area fails.
! The preferred routes all travel through the backbone, where in this not-so-practical design, the route through here is always one more area-hop to the backbone. From area 1 to area 3 and vice versa, it's a shorter distance, but again, the routes by design force traffic through the backbone in a spur-like fashion.
! Update: In testing, the lack of inter-area route exchange from this router doesn't work with the network's design, currently. Therefore, I'd have to find some other way to use totally-stub areas.

router ospf 1
area 1 nssa no-summary
area 3 stub no-summary
exit

ipv6 router ospf 1
exit
