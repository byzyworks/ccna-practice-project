! For some very odd reason, Packet Tracer does not support redistributing default routes into NSSAs.
! It supports it for regular stub areas, but somehow, the command below, which is necessary for this redistribution, is not available in PT:
! area # nssa default-information originate
! Therefore, these devices are given manual static default routes as a workaround.
! On the plus side, it gets to demonstrate creating "backup" static routes by manipulating administrative distance.

ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.1.5 100
ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 10.1.1.14 110
